SectionB Directions:In this section,you are going to reada passage with tenstatements attachedto it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet2.
CompaniesAreWorkingwithConsumerstoReduceWaste [A] As consumers, we are very wasteful. Annually, the world generates 1.3 billion tons of solid waste. This is expected to go up to 2.2 billion by 2025. The developed countries are responsible for 44% of waste, and in the U.S. alone, the average person throws away their body weightinrubbisheverymonth. [B] Conventional wisdom would seem to suggest that companies have no incentive to lengthen the life cycle of their products and reduce the revenue they would get from selling new goods. Yet, more and more businesses are thinking about how to reduce consumer waste. This is partly driven by the rising price of raw materials and metals. It is also partly due to both consumersandcompaniesbecomingmoreawareoftheneedtoprotectourenvironment. [C] When choosing what products to buy and which brands to buy from, more and more consumers are looking into sustainability.This is opposed to just price and performance they were concerned about in the past. In a survey of 54 of the world’s leading brands, almost all of them reported thatconsumers are showing increasing careaboutsustainable lifestyles.At the same time, surveys on consumers in the U.S. and the U.K. show that they also care about minimizing energy useandreducingwaste. [D] For the most part, consumerscontrol whathappens to a product.But some companies are realizing that placing the burden of recycling entirely on the consumer is not an effective strategy, especiallywhentossingsomethingawayseemslike theeasiestandmostconvenientoption. [E] Some retailers and manufacturers in the clothing, footwear, and electronics industries have launched environmental programs. They want to make their customers interested in preserving their products and preventing things that still have value from going to the garbage dump. By offering services to help expand the longevity of their products, they’re promising quality and durability to consumers, and receiving the reputational gains for being environmentallyfriendly. [F] For example, the Swedish jeans company Nudie Jeans offers free repair at twenty of their shops. Instead of discarding their old worn-out jeans, customers bring them in to be renewed.The company even provides mail-order repair kits and online videos, so that customers can learn how to fix a pair of jeans at home. Their philosophy is that extending the life of a pair of jeans is not only great for the environment, but allows the consumer to get more value out of their product. When customers do want to toss their pair, they can give them back to the store, which will repurpose and resell them. Another clothing company, Patagonia, a high-end outdoor clothing store, follows the same principle. It has partnered with DIYwebsite iFixit to teach consumers how to repair their clothing, such as waterproof outerwear, at home. The company also offers a repair program for their customers for a modest fee. Currently, Patagonia repairs about 40,000 garments a year in their Reno, Nevada, service center. According to the company’s CEO, Rose Marcario, this is about building a company that cares about the environment. At the same time, offering

repairsupportstheperceivedqualityofitsproducts. [G] In Brazil, the multinational corporation Adidas has been running a shoe-recycling program called “Sustainable Footprint” since 2012. Customers can bring shoes of any brand into an Adidas store to be shredded and turned into alternative fuels for energy creation instead of being burned as trash. They are used to fuel cement ovens. To motivate visitors to bring in more old shoes,Adidas Brazil promotes the program in stores by showing videos to educate customers, and it even offers a discount each time a customer brings in an old pair of shoes. This boosts the reputationandimage ofAdidasbymaking peoplemoreawareofthecompany’svalues. [H] Enormous opportunities also lie with e-waste. It is estimated that in 2014 the world produced some 42 million metric tons of e-waste (discarded electrical and electronic equipment and its parts) with North America and Europe accounting for 8 and 12 million metric tons respectively. The materials from e-waste include iron, copper, gold, silver, and aluminum materials that could be reused, resold, salvaged, or recycled. Together,the value of these metals is estimated to be about $52 billion. Electronics giants like Best Buy and Samsung have provided e-waste take-back programs over the past few years, which aim to refurbish (翻新) old electronic componentsandpartsintonewproducts. [I] For other companies interested in reducing waste, helping the environment, and providing the sustainable lifestyles that consumers seek, here are some first steps for building a relationship withcustomersthatfocusesonrecyclingandrestoringvaluetoproducts: [J] Find partners. If you are a manufacturer who relies on outside distributors, then retailers are the ideal partner for collecting old products. Power tool maker DeWalt partners with companies, such as Lowes and Napa Auto Parts, to collect old tools at their stores for recycling. The partnership benefits both sides by allowing unconventional partners (for example, two companies from two different industries) to work together on a specific aspect of the value chain, like,inthisexample,anenginefirmwithanaccessoryone. [K] Create incentives. Environmental conscientiousness isn’t always enough to make customers recycle old goods. For instance, DeWalt discovered that many contractors were holding on to their old tools, even if they no longer worked, because they were expensive purchases and it was hard to justify bringing them in to recycle. By offering instant discounts worth as much as $100, DeWalt launched a trade-in program to encourage people to bring back tools. As a result, DeWaltnowreusesthosematerialstocreatenewproducts. [L] Start with a trial program, and expect to change the details as you go. Any take-back program will likely change over time, depending on what works for your customers and company goals. Maybe you see low customer participation at first, or conversely, so much success that the cost of recycling becomes too high. Best Buy, for instance, has been bearing the lion’s share of e-waste volume since two of its largest competitors,Amazon andWal-mart, do not have their own recycling programs. Since the launch of its program, Best Buy changed its policy to add a $25 fee forrecyclingoldtelevisionsinordertokeeptheprogramgoing. [M] Build a culture of collective values with customers. Astronger relationship between the retailer/producer and the consumer isn’t just about financial incentives. By creating more awareness around your efforts to reduce waste, and by developing a culture of responsibility, repair,andreuse,you canbuildcustomerloyaltybasedonsharedvaluesandresponsibilities. [N] These examples are just the tip of the iceberg, but they demonstrate how helping customers get more use of their materials can transform value chains and operations. Reducing waste by incorporating used materials into production can cut costs and decrease the price of procurement (采购): less to be procured from the outside and more to be re-utilized from the

inside. [O] Companies play a big role in creating a circular economy, in which value is generating less from extracting new resources and more from getting better use out of the resources we alreadyhave--buttheymustalsogetcustomersengagedintheprocess.
36. Some companies believe that products’prolonged lifespan benefits both the environment andcustomers. 37. A survey shows shoppers today are getting more concerned about energy conservation andenvironmentalprotectionwhendecidingwhattobuy. 38. Companies can build customer loyalty by creating a positive culture of environmental awareness. 39.

Effective Friday, Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has declared a strike against 11 video game publishers over games that went into production after Feb. 17, 2015. The companies include some of the heavyweights of the industry, likeElectronicArtsProductions,InsomniacGames,ActivisionandDisney. The strike comesin light ofan unsuccessful19monthsofnegotiationsafter theexisting labor contract known as the Interactive Media Agreement expired in late 2014. overall, the strike is an effort to provide more secondary compensation along with other concerns, such as transparency uponhiringtalentandon-set(制作中)safetyprecautions. The video gaming industry hasballooned in recent years.The LosAngelesTimes reports that

the industry is in the midst of an intense increase in cash flow. In 2015, gaming produced $23.5 billionindomesticrevenue. ButSAG-AFTRAsaysvoice actorsdon’treceive residuals(追加酬金)fortheirgaming work. Instead, they receive a fixed rate, which is typically about $825 for a standard four-hour vocal session. So the voice actors are pushing for the idea of secondary compensation—a performance bonus every time a game sells 2 million copies or downloads, or reaches 2 million subscribers, withacapat8million. “It’s a very small number of games that would trigger this secondary compensation issue,” said voice actor Crispin Freeman, who’s a member of the union’s negotiating committee. “This is an important aspect of what it means to be a freelance (从事自由职业的) performer, who isn’t regularlyemployed everysingle dayworkingonprojects.” Another major complaint from the actors is the secrecy of the industry. “I can’t imagine if there’s any other acting job in the world where you don’t know what show you’re in, when you’re hired,”saysvoiceactorKeytheFarley,whochairstheSAG-AFTRAnegotiatingcommittee. “And yet that happens every day in the video game world,” Farley told reporters during a press conference Friday.“I was a main character in Fallout 4, a character by the name of Kellogg, andIneverknewthatIwasdoingvocalrecordingforthatgame throughouttheyearandahalf.” Scott Witlin, the lawyer representing the video game companies, says voice actors “represent lessthan one tenth of1 percentofthe work that goesinto making a video game.”So “even though they’re the top craftsmen in their field,” Witlin says, “if we pay them under a vastly different system than the people who do the 99.9 percent of the work, that’s going to create far more problemsforthevideogamecompanies.”

PassageTwo Questions51to55arebasedonthefollowingpassage.
Officials at the White House announced a new space policy focused on managing the increasing number of satellites that companies and governments are launching into space. Space Policy Directive-3 lays out general guidelines for the United States to mitigate (缓解) the effects ofspacedebrisandtrackandmanage trafficinspace. This policy sets the stage for the Department of Commerce to take over the management of traffic in space. The department will make sure that newly launched satellites don’t use radio frequenciesthat would interfere with existing satellites, and schedule when such new satellites can be launched. This only applies to American space activities, but the hope is that it will help standardizeasetofnormsinthedawningcommercialspaceflightindustrythroughouttheworld. Space, especially the space directly around our planet, is getting more crowded as more governments and companies launch satellites. One impetus for the policy is that companies are already starting to build massive constellations (星座), comprising hundreds or thousands of satellites with many moving parts among them. With so much stuff in space, and a limited area around our planet, the government wants to reduce the chances of a collision. Two or more satellites slamming into each other could create many more out-of-control bits that would pose evenmorehazardstothegrowingcollectionofsatellitesinspace. And it’s not like this hasn’t happened before. In 2009 an old Russian craft slammed into a communications satellite, creating a cloud of hundreds of pieces of debris and putting other hardware at risk. Journalist Sarah Scoles reports that NASAcurrently tracks about 24,000 objects in space, and in 2016 the Air Force had to issue 3,995,874 warnings to satellite owners alerting themtoapotentialnearbythreatfromanothersatellite orbitofdebris. That’s why this new policy also includes directions to update the current U.S. Government Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices, which already require any entity that launches a satellite or spacecraft to vigorously analyze the likelihood that any of their actions, from an unexpected failure or normal operations, will create more space debris. It includes accounting for any piece of debris they plan to release over 5mm that might stay in orbit for 25 years or more. It might seem surprising to think about an item staying in space for that long, but the oldest satellite stillinorbit-Vanguard1-turned60in2018. Agencies and companies throughout the world are working on developing technology that would dispose of or capture space debris before it causes serious damage. But for now, the U.S. government is more focused on preventing new debris from forming than taking the trash out of orbit.
